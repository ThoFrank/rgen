=Known Bugs
* <% expand ... :indent => 0 %> seems to change behaviour of active template not only expanded subtemplate
* Ecore build in types (EString, ...) do not work in ECore instantiator, define your own EDatatype instead

=Major issues 
* XML instantiator documentation
* revise builder datatypes, especially enum implementation using Enum objects as types, 
  also revise ecore metamodel at this point
* revise documentation of BuilderExtensions
* template language: do not indent first line of an expanded template if
  there are characters left of the expand call in the call's line

=Minor Issues
* allow definition of templates from within regular code
* indexed find in environment
